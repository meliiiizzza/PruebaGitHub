                    <p>To get a better idea of the cost of what you want to build, give us a quick phone call. We’ll ask you a few questions about the nature of the site, what sort of interactivity the site will have, your graphic design needs, etc. 
                        Then we’ll be able to give you a ballpark figure. 
                        If you’re still interested, we’ll come to your place of business and come up with a firm quote.</p>
